Existing Bugs:
--------------
1) Not being able to handle the lexer rules for STRING (it is still not included)
2) The Vector<string> used for set of RESERVED WORDS does not work if the version of gcc/g++ is high enough. ---> Need to test this part on Storm/Thunder
3) Program starts generating tokens but quits midway because of wrong token encounter.
