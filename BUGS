1) Still could not run with difftest.pl so couldn't check all the functions at a go.
2) Again manually ran against all the functions listed in tests folder, about half of them ran fine and produced exactly same output, and half of them didn't
3) The ones that didn't run all ran into "Expected dummy but found <something>" error.
4) Full CSE Machine implemented -- but runs into "undefined element -- exiting" error.
