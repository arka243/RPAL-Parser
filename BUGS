BUGS:
----
1) Still could not run with difftest.pl so couldn't check all the functions at a go.
2) Mnually ran against all the functions listed in tests folder, about half of them ran fine and produced exactly same output for AST, and half of them didn't
3) The ones that didn't run ran into "Expected dummy but found <something>" error while producing AST. [Still cannot figure out what is going wrong!]
4) Standardization of tree implemented -- working fine [use flag -std instead of -ast to check standardizing]
5) Control Structure generation from Standardized tree implemented. No error encountered.
6) Full CSE Machine implemented ---> [ERROR: Element mismatch and tuple printing related issues! debugging]
7) Tuple printing has a problem (runs into infinite loop -> looking into the fix)

** UPDATE:
========= 
List of programs running fine as of now are:

1) defns.1
2) t1
3) pf
4) envlist
5) stem1
6) stem2
7) add (partially -- gives -15 instead of 15)
